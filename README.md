 ## Recommendation

 	1. Expand business in Europe which is a high sales potential area(NE and SE has low sales but highest  sales increase % in 2021)
	
	2.Increase direct customer and distributer number as company gain high Gross Margin % from these two( only 22% customers)  
	(Can provide some initial offer for direct customer and distributer to attract them)
	
	3. Reset the product price for retail customer as retail customers contribute highest to the sales but improper pricing policy reducing
	GM% of company ( reset the price for retail customer who have low GM% but high sales increase % in 2021)
	
	4. Proper development and marketing strategy for new products of storage segment as company launch a good number of new product
	but people are still buying old products more. 
	
	5. Reduce the stocks of regular products and increase new products of accessories segment as new products have high sales per product value 
	then regular products
